# Java Banking System 3 â€” Price Comparison Website

This project builds on the banking and shopping system from previous assignments by introducing a **price comparison website**. It enables users to compare item prices across multiple online shops and find the best offers or best-rated shops.

## ðŸ§© The Task

You must **implement the missing logic** in the following file:

- `PriceComparisonWebsite.java`

Look for the `TODO` comments in each file. The unit tests in `PriceComparisonWebsiteTest.java` will check that:

- Finding the **cheapest shop** offering a specific item.
- Finding the **best-rated shop** that offers a specific item.
- Returning all matching items across shops, **sorted by price** (ascending).

Each `OnlineShop` is initialized with the following items:

- Spezi â€“ 20â‚¬
- Cola â€“ 30â‚¬
- Sprite â€“ 25â‚¬

You can also add more items using `addItem(...)`.
